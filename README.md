# Housetable Mini Project
Clone this repository to your computer. If you do not yet have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) installed on your computer you must do this in order to be able to run this project.

To see if Node is installed, open the command prompt or terminal, and type `node -v` . If you have Node installed this should print the version number so you'll see something like this `v0.10.35`.

## Starting the Server
1. After completing the previous steps, open the repository in your IDE. This should work in any IDE but these steps were confirmed to be correct in **VS Code**.
2. Open a new terminal and go into the *server* directory using the `cd server` command.
3. Now that you are in the server directory, run the `npm install` command to install all of the necessary dependacies.
4. Run the `npm run dev` command to start the server.

You should now have the server running on **port 5000**.

*Note: If port 5000 is not available and you need to run the server on a different port this can be changed in the `server.js` file.*
